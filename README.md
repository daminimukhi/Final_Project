# Understanding Anxiety Attacks: Factors, Symptoms, and Severity Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore various factors and symptoms that contribute to anxiety attacks, with a focus on predicting their severity. Using a dataset from Kaggle, machine learning models will be developed to analyze patterns and predict anxiety severity levels.

## Dataset Information
- **Source:** Kaggle dataset by Ashay Choudhary  
- **Link:** [Anxiety Attack Factors Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashaychoudhary/anxiety-attack-factors-symptoms-and-severity)  
- **Format:** CSV  
- **Number of Records:** ~600 rows  
- **Features:** Age, gender, physical symptoms, stress levels, and severity of anxiety attacks.

## Project Timeline (Gantt Chart)
A Gantt chart has been created to visualize the project timeline, highlighting key tasks such as data collection, preprocessing, model development, and report writing. The final report and ReadMe file preparation are also included.

## How to Run the Gantt Chart Script
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```sh
   pip install matplotlib pandas numpy
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python gantt_chart.py
   ```
4. The Gantt chart will be displayed, showing the project timeline.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x  
- Matplotlib  
- Pandas  
- NumPy
